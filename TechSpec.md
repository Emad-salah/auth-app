# Project Technical Specification

## Project Overview

This document outlines the technical specifications for a web application built using Next.js, NextAuth for authentication, TypeScript for type safety, Material-UI for the user interface components, and modular SCSS for styling. The application's primary focus is to provide a seamless and visually appealing user experience while ensuring maintainability, scalability, and code quality.

## Introduction

### Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a website that allows users to authenticate using supported providers from NextAuth. The site will leverage the Next.js framework and will be developed using JavaScript/Typescript.

### Scope

The following requirements must be met in order to successfully complete this project:

- The site should have a simple, responsive and user-friendly design.
- Users should be able to authenticate using an authentication provider supported by NextAuth.
- Once authenticated, users should be presented with profile data retrieved from the [authentication provider](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/).
- Users should be able to log out of the site.

## Architecture and Technologies

### Frontend Framework: Next.js

Next.js will be used as the core frontend framework. It provides server-side rendering (SSR), automatic code splitting, and an intuitive routing system.

### Authentication: NextAuth

NextAuth will handle user authentication, providing features like OAuth, JWT, and session management out of the box.

### Language: TypeScript

TypeScript will be used to ensure type safety, enhanced development productivity, and better code quality.

### UI Framework: Material-UI

Material-UI will be used for creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces with pre-designed components.

### Styling: Modular SCSS

Modular SCSS (Sass) will be used to manage styling. Each component will have its own SCSS module, allowing for isolated and maintainable styles.

## Project Structure

### `src/` directory structure

Next.js's `src/` directory will house the application's pages and routes. Each folder in this directory corresponds to a route.

### `components/` directory structure

Reusable UI components will be organized within the `components/` directory that is within the page that is using it. Each component should have its own folder containing the component's code and SCSS module.

### Styling and SCSS organization

SCSS styles will be modularized and organized in a way that corresponds to the component structure. SCSS modules should follow a naming convention that relates to the component's name.

## Authentication Flow

### User registration

NextAuth's built-in registration flow will be utilized, allowing users to create accounts with email/password or third-party providers.

### User login

Users will be able to log in using their registered credentials or third-party authentication providers integrated through NextAuth.

### Protected routes

Certain routes will be protected, requiring users to be authenticated before accessing them. NextAuth's session management will be used to determine user authentication status.

## UI Components and Layout

### Layout structure using Material-UI components

Material-UI's layout components like `AppBar`, `Drawer`, and `Container` will be utilized to create a consistent and responsive layout.

### Reusable UI components

Reusable components such as buttons, cards, modals, and forms will be designed and organized within the `components/` directory. These components will follow Material-UI's design principles.

## Styling and Theming

### Theming using Material-UI's theme customization

Material-UI's theming will be customized to maintain a consistent visual style and to enable easy theming adjustments.

### Modular SCSS for component-specific styling

Each UI component will have its own SCSS module for styling. SCSS files will follow a modular structure to avoid global styling conflicts.

## Type Safety

### TypeScript interfaces and types

TypeScript interfaces and types will be defined for props, states, and data structures to ensure type safety and improve code readability.

### Proper type annotations for components and functions

All components and functions will have proper type annotations to enhance code documentation and development experience.

## Deployment and Hosting

### Deployment options (e.g., Vercel, Netlify)

The application will be deployed using Vercel, ensuring easy deployment and hosting.

### Environment configuration and secrets handling

Environment variables will be used to store sensitive information such as API keys and secrets. Proper handling and management of environment variables will be maintained.

### Code linting and formatting (ESLint, Prettier)

ESLint and Prettier will be used to maintain consistent code style and catch potential issues during development.
